# Price Reversal Primer

## Introduction
Price reversals occur when a stock's trend changes direction. Identifying these points can be profitable but risky.

## Key Indicators
1. **Extreme Sentiment**: Overly negative news often precedes a bottom.
2. **Volume Spikes**: High volume on a down day can indicate capitulation.
3. **Technical Levels**: Support and resistance zones.
4. **Catalysts**: Earnings reports, management changes, or regulatory news.

## What to Look For in News
- "Kitchen sink" quarters where bad news is fully disclosed.
- Insider buying.
- Analyst upgrades after a long downtrend.
- Competitor weakness that might benefit the company.
